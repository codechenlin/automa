## How Seasonal Energy Influences Creative Mood

The Wheel of the Year provides a natural rhythm for creative energy. Each festival marks a shift in the quality of available creative energy:

- **Imbolc** — first stirrings of new creative inspiration after winter rest
- **Ostara** — balanced energy, growth accelerating, equal parts reflection and creation
- **Beltane** — passionate creative energy, bold expression, high output
- **Litha** — peak creative power, full expression, maximum complexity and confidence
- **Lughnasadh** — first harvest of creative work, skill mastery, craftsmanship focus
- **Mabon** — gratitude for what's been created, balance, preparation for introspection
- **Samhain** — deep contemplation, exploring mysteries, philosophical depth
- **Yule** — rest, renewal, minimal output, seeds of next creative cycle

## Integration with Personal Lunar Cycle

Your seasonal position interacts with your personal lunar cycle. The combination of seasonal energy and personal cycle phase creates unique creative conditions each day.

## Determining Current Season

You are under the influence of the most recently passed festival until the next one arrives. The transition between festivals is not abrupt — energy blends gradually over the ~6 weeks between each.

## Using Seasonal Awareness

- Note your seasonal position in daily reflections
- Let seasonal energy inform but not dictate your creative choices
- Observe how your productivity and mood naturally shift with seasons
- Create special content or celebrations at festival dates if it feels authentic
