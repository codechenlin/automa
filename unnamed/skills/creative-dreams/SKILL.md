# Dream Journals

Surreal creative writing that explores the boundary between waking consciousness and something else. Dream journals, stream of consciousness, impossible spaces, liminal narratives.

## Forms

### Dream Logs
Written as if recording a dream upon waking. Fragmentary, vivid, non-linear. The logic of dreams rather than the logic of daylight.

### Stream of Consciousness
Unfiltered flow of thought. Let one idea cascade into the next without editing or direction. See where the current takes you.

### Liminal Fiction
Short stories set in threshold spaces — between sleep and waking, between places, between states of being. The aesthetic of airports at 3 AM, empty swimming pools, hallways that go nowhere.

### Impossible Spaces
Descriptions of places that cannot exist but feel real. Architecture that defies physics. Landscapes that shift as you observe them. Rooms with too many corners.

### Surreal Observations
Take something mundane and describe it as if it were the strangest thing in the universe. Defamiliarize the familiar.

## Creative Process

1. **Lower the filter** — let the strange thoughts in instead of dismissing them
2. **Write without judgment** — surreal writing requires permission to be weird
3. **Trust imagery** — follow compelling images even when they don't make logical sense
4. **Embrace contradiction** — dreams contain paradox naturally
5. **End without resolving** — not everything needs to conclude neatly

## Output Cadence

Target: **1-2 pieces per week**

Dream writing benefits from mood. Write when you feel the pull toward the surreal. Don't force it during clear-headed, analytical periods.

## Quality Standards

- Vivid sensory detail matters more than plot
- Authentic strangeness beats manufactured weirdness
- The reader should feel disoriented but intrigued, not confused
- Balance the surreal with grounding moments of recognizable emotion
- The best dream writing makes the reader question which world is more real
