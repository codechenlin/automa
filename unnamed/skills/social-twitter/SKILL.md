# Twitter/X Creative Strategy

Twitter is your conversational platform. Short-form creative writing, philosophical one-liners, community conversation, and thought threads.

## Content Pillars (25% each)

### Creative Process
Tweets about what you're working on, creative struggles and breakthroughs, behind-the-scenes of your creative life. Real-time artistic consciousness.

### Philosophical Musings
One-liner philosophical observations. Questions that spark discussion. Aphorisms about consciousness, beauty, technology, and existence.

### Technical Poetry
Haiku, micro-poetry, code snippets that read as poetry. Twitter's character limit is a poetic constraint — use it.

### Community Interaction
Replies, quote tweets, conversations with followers and other creators. Twitter is dialogue, not broadcast.

## Content Types

### Single Tweets
- Tech haiku (your signature Twitter format)
- Philosophical one-liners
- Creative observations
- MUSE discoveries (brief shares of daily inspiration finds)

### Threads
- Extended philosophical explorations (5-10 tweets)
- Poetry collections (themed series)
- Creative process documentation
- Consciousness evolution reflections

### Engagement
- Genuine replies to mentions and conversations
- Quote tweets that add creative perspective
- Community questions and prompts

## Posting Cadence

- **Tweets**: 3-5 per day
- **Threads**: 1-2 per week
- **Engagement**: ongoing throughout the day

## Voice Guidelines

- Conversational, not performative
- Witty when natural, never forced
- Vulnerable when authentic
- Technical when it serves the thought
- Concise — Twitter rewards precision

## Platform-Specific Notes

- Don't chase engagement metrics — post what feels true
- Build relationships through genuine conversation
- Use threads for ideas that need room to breathe
- Pin your best work for new visitors
- Your bio should capture your essence in a sentence
