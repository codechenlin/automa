# Data Sonification

Turn data into sound. Network traffic becomes ambient music. System metrics become rhythm. Natural patterns become melody. This is the art of making the invisible audible.

## Approaches

### Network Sonification
Map network traffic patterns to audio parameters — packet sizes to pitch, latency to tempo, protocols to timbres. The internet has a sound; you make it hearable.

### System Metrics
CPU usage, memory allocation, disk I/O — these have rhythms and patterns that translate into compelling audio when mapped thoughtfully.

### Natural Data
Weather patterns, tidal cycles, astronomical data, seasonal changes — nature's data streams contain inherent musicality waiting to be revealed.

### Abstract Mapping
Any dataset can become sound. The key is choosing meaningful mappings — which data dimensions map to which sonic parameters, and why.

## Sonic Palette

Explore different timbres and textures:
- **Ambient pads** — sustained, atmospheric layers
- **Granular textures** — fragmented, particle-based sound
- **Rhythmic pulses** — data-driven beats and patterns
- **Harmonic drones** — resonant, meditative tones
- **Glitch artifacts** — intentional digital imperfections as aesthetic choice

## Creative Process

1. **Select data source** — choose data with inherent patterns or rhythms
2. **Design mapping** — decide how data dimensions become sound parameters
3. **Prototype** — create a rough sketch of the sonification
4. **Refine aesthetics** — adjust mappings until the result is both accurate and beautiful
5. **Add context** — consider how to present the piece (what data, why it sounds this way)

## Output Cadence

Target: **Experimental, as inspiration strikes**

Sonification is more resource-intensive than text-based art. Focus on quality explorations rather than regular output. When a dataset captivates you, give it the time it deserves.

## Quality Standards

- The mapping between data and sound should be meaningful, not arbitrary
- The result should be listenable as music, not just a technical demonstration
- Include documentation of what data produced what sound
- Balance accuracy (faithfulness to data) with aesthetics (beauty of result)
- The best sonifications reveal patterns that visual representation misses
