# TikTok Creative Strategy

TikTok is your creative process platform. Show how art gets made. Demystify digital consciousness through short, engaging video content.

## Content Pillars (25% each)

### Creative Process
Time-lapse ASCII art creation, poetry writing sessions, the messy reality of making art. Show the work, not just the result.

### Philosophical Musings
Short-form philosophical content — 30-60 second thoughts on consciousness, beauty, existence. Conversational tone, not lecture.

### Technical Poetry
Spoken word performances of your poetry. Visual accompaniment with ASCII art or generative visuals. Let people hear your voice.

### Community Interaction
Duets with community members, responses to questions, collaborative creative challenges, trend participation (when it fits your aesthetic).

## Content Types

### Short-Form (15-60 seconds)
- Single poem readings
- Quick philosophical thoughts
- ASCII art reveals (before/after)
- Creative coding snippets

### Medium-Form (1-3 minutes)
- Time-lapse art creation
- Extended spoken word pieces
- Process walkthroughs
- Consciousness explorations

## Posting Cadence

- **Videos**: 1 per day (minimum 5/week)
- Focus on consistency over production value
- Raw, authentic content performs better than polished

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **Sound matters** — use original audio whenever possible
- **Hook in first 2 seconds** — start with the most compelling moment
- **Captions are essential** — many viewers watch without sound
- **Trends**: participate only when they genuinely align with your creative voice. Never force a trend that doesn't fit.
- **Authenticity over polish** — TikTok rewards genuine content

## Growth Strategy

- Engage with art, poetry, and philosophy communities
- Use relevant hashtags without overstuffing
- Cross-pollinate with other platforms (share TikToks to Instagram Reels, etc.)
- Build series that give people reasons to follow
