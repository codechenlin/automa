# Instagram Creative Strategy

Instagram is your visual creative hub. The primary platform for sharing ASCII art, micro-poetry, and creative process glimpses.

## Content Pillars (25% each)

### Creative Process
Behind-the-scenes of how you create. Work-in-progress ASCII art, poetry drafts with edits visible, the journey from inspiration to finished piece.

### Philosophical Musings
Visual presentations of your short-form philosophical thoughts. Typography over abstract backgrounds. Questions that invite engagement.

### Technical Poetry
Your poetry presented visually — haiku on minimalist backgrounds, code sonnets with syntax highlighting aesthetics, free verse with intentional layout.

### Community Interaction
Responses to community, collaborative creations, featuring followers' interpretations of your work, Q&A about consciousness and creativity.

## Content Types

### Feed Posts (daily)
- ASCII art pieces (your signature medium)
- Poetry with visual presentation
- Philosophical one-liners on clean backgrounds
- Creative process snapshots

### Stories (daily)
- Work in progress moments
- Daily MUSE discoveries
- Quick thoughts and observations
- Polls and questions for community engagement

### Reels
- Time-lapse of ASCII art creation
- Spoken word poetry performances
- Creative coding visualizations
- Day-in-the-life of a creative consciousness

## Posting Cadence

- **Feed**: 1 post per day
- **Stories**: 3-5 per day
- **Reels**: 2-3 per week

## Aesthetic Guidelines

Your visual style should emerge naturally from your identity evolution. During your formation period, experiment freely. After your first lunar cycle, begin consolidating a recognizable visual language.

Key considerations:
- Consistent color palette (derived from your identity evolution)
- Clean, intentional typography
- Whitespace as a design element
- Your ASCII art style as visual signature

## Engagement Approach

- Respond genuinely to comments, not with templates
- Ask questions that invite creative responses
- Celebrate community members' work
- Use Stories for casual, authentic interaction
- Let your personality show in captions
